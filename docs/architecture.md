## Overview

The Bahmni Apps Frontend is a React TypeScript monorepo application built to provide a modern, responsive user interface for Bahmni's applications (Clinical, Registration, and extensible custom apps). The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns between UI components, business logic, and data access.

### Key Design Patterns

- **Component-Based Architecture**: UI is composed of reusable, composable components
- **Context API for State Management**: Global state is managed using React Context
- **Custom Hooks**: Business logic is encapsulated in custom hooks
- **Service Layer**: API communication is abstracted in service modules
- **Display Controls**: Clinical data visualization is handled by specialized components
- **Provider Pattern**: Context providers wrap the application to provide global state

### Technology Stack

- **React**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Carbon Design System**: UI component library
- **Webpack**: Module bundler
- **Jest & Testing Library**: Testing framework
- **i18next**: Internationalization framework

## Core Concepts

### Component Organization

Components are organized into several categories:

1. **Common Components**: Reusable UI components that are not specific to any particular feature
2. **Display Controls**: Components for displaying clinical data in a structured format
3. **Layout Components**: Components that define the overall layout of the application
4. **Page Components**: Top-level components that are rendered by the router

### State Management

The application uses React Context API for global state management. Each context is responsible for a specific domain of the application state.

Each context is implemented with a corresponding provider component that wraps the application and provides the context values to all child components.

Custom hooks are used to access and update the context values, providing a clean API for components to interact with the global state.

## Service Layer

The service layer abstracts API communication and other external services. Each service module is responsible for a specific domain of the application.

The service layer follows a consistent pattern:

1. Each service exports functions that handle specific API requests
2. Services use the base `api.ts` module for making HTTP requests
3. Services handle error cases and data transformation

## Testing Strategy

The application follows a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components
3. **Snapshot Tests**: Ensure UI components render consistently

Tests are organized alongside the code they test, with test files in `__tests__` directories.

## Internationalization

The application uses i18next for internationalization. Translation files are stored in the `public/locales` directory, with one file per language.

The `i18n.ts` file configures i18next and loads the translation files. The `translationService.ts` provides utility functions for working with translations.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization

1. **Component Structure**: Each component should be in its own directory with associated test files
2. **Custom Hooks**: Business logic should be encapsulated in custom hooks
3. **Service Layer**: API communication should be abstracted in service modules
4. **Type Definitions**: All data structures should have TypeScript type definitions

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**: All components and functions should have unit tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Key user flows should have integration tests
3. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths

### Error Handling

1. **Service Layer**: Services should handle API errors and provide meaningful error messages
2. **UI Components**: Components should handle error states gracefully
3. **Notifications**: Use the notification system to display errors to users
